# Reflection
For this final test, I created a complete version control workflow using GitHub. I created a repository, added a README, created a milestone, and added two issues linked to that milestone. I uploaded both a Python file and a template file to the repository. By doing this, I learned how to manage version control, organize tasks using issues, and keep project progress clear through milestones. This helped me understand how real software projects are managed using Git and GitHub.
